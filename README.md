I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

This is a simple MongoDB client I made for testing. It simulates a user login registration tool and testing the user login.
The program will also create a new database and collections so no need to create those manually.

The program uses bcrypt to hash the password in the database.

UI created in Qt Designer

Click on run.bat to run the program, the bat file will all required dependencies.

Tested with [MongoDB Cloud](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) and MongoDB on Docker.

Best Regards,<br/>
Brian
